# 11ty-web-components-scaffold

This template is a collection on configurations that i've taken from my own website, which may be useful. Much of it is similar/ the same as https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog with extra stuff sprinkled on top.

For something more production ready checkout https://github.com/modernweb-dev/rocket
I may switch to their tooling at some point myself :)

> There has been little effort to tidy up a lot of the config, it's just what I find to be useful at the time for getting me started fast, by cloning this repo.
